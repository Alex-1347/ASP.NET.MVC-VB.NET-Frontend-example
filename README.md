# This is example of ASP.NET (VB.NET) frontend. I publish it for learn purposes for beginners. This project allow beginners to understand what is real commercial project and how commercial project is composed.
Firstly, this project contains more than 90% of code in two end user frontend in KOTLIN lang - https://xd.adobe.com/view/ec035ceb-4944-443b-95ea-afe483643466-b950/grid/ and https://xd.adobe.com/view/521b2f20-a023-4aec-995a-30b8e955df1c-0748/grid/     
Rest 10% of code is split to 3 parts is VB.NET code:    
(1) 90% of VB.NET Code is WCF REST API, I don't publish it because this is critical part of commercial application.   
(2) 1% of code is Windows Service. Goal Windows service is push notification to Google Firebase.   
(3) Other part is Admin panel to application server. Apllication server contains most of code in ServiceController.vb   
to avoid violation of project owner right I delete this huge part of code

So, Admin panel at all contains less than 1% of project code, and I deleted about 50% of that code. And in this example Admin panel is not finished yet. Only 20-30% of code is finished in current state of published code, look to this screen

So, as a result, we can see less than 0,01% of project code. This project code is not critical for other part, not contains credential, but very important for beginners to lear how real project is buil at all. 

I create huge description for beginners - what skills is most important to create similar projects, look please http://vb-net.com/MVC-future/Index.htm
